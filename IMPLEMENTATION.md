This implements a leaderboard system with Elo based player rankings. It tracks wins, losses, and ratings of players, updates standings after each match, and sorts players by performance metrics.

The system has these components (so far):
> Player - each individual player with wins, losses, and elo rating
> Leaderboard - manages players, records match results, and generates rankings
> Elo - handles all elo calculations and updates
